ACE OF CUPS (Reversed)

When the Ace of Cups is overturned, the image here is clearest - the waters pour out of the cup, it becomes empty, the gift of its waters are being wasted. Seeing the Ace of Cups upside down during your reading means you have been enduring emotional instability or pain for some time. There is a loss that is indicated here, and perhaps something that has meant much to you is no longer giving you the joy that it once had. 

Since the cups also govern creativity, you may also be experiencing a creative block of sorts, and where the waters of inspiration once flowed, they have now dried up. 

In all these cases you must examine who or what is in control of the cup - which party allowed it to overturn? What can you do to place it right side up again?

TWO OF CUPS (Upright)

If you are looking for new job opportunities, this card may be a good sign. In terms of love, the card represents commitment, a balanced relationship, and love. But this does not simply mean that you will no longer need to nurture your love to make it last. The card only signifies that true love and affection is present.

In your finances, the Two of Cups is associated with fairness and balance. This means that you are currently financially capable and you have the right amount of money to deal with your obligations. In relation with your health, people who are currently facing some health issues need to look for a practitioner that they will be comfortable working with and whom they can trust. In spirituality, it is a call for you to be more endearing and loving towards the others. You are receiving positive energy from the universe, and you need to share that energy.

Two of Cups (Reversed),"-------------------------------------------------
TWO OF CUPS (Reversed)

When reversed, the Two of Cups can mean that the balance that was once there is broken. This balance was an integral part of keeping the individuals together, but to break it is to create disconnection and discord. The negative energy of two forces is present, and instead of them joining or attracting, they seem to repel each other.

You may be finding that certain small details that were not problems before are coming into play, signaling that one party may have resentments. A line of communication that allowed you and the other party to openly talk about disagreements has been cut off, only worsening the cycle of resentment and imbalance.

Be the first to open up, and you may find the problem much easier to repair than you thought it would be.

Five of Cups(Upright),"-------------------------------------------------
FIVE OF CUPS (Upright)

The Five of Cups symbolizes disappointment, and the feelings that come when things go differently as you expected. You are feeling unhappy that a certain situation hasn’t really turned out the way you have hoped it would. Instead of moving towards a more positive perspective, this card seems to say that you are dwelling in the past, inducing feelings of self-pity and regret.

SIX OF CUPS (Upright)

The Six of Cups upright generally represents generosity, naïve happiness, and childhood. It can stand for you wanting to return to a happier time, whether it was when you were a child, teenager, or young adult. Many times, these memories are things of the past, which reflect the aspects of ourselves that have vanished. You may feel that remembering these times is the only way to feel happy. The Six of Cups appearing in a reading seems to indicate that while we may look upon the past with a happy eye, we must avoid living in it.

The Six of Cups can also mean that you are be returning to a familiar place. This could be your hometown, an old friend’s home, a school, or any place that holds a lot of meaning for you. You are seeking to reconnect with people from your past. Bringing back old memories reminds us of our childhood, a time when things were simpler.

SIX OF CUPS (Reversed)

The Six of Cups reversed can mean that you are clinging to the past. You should explore your memories, but you should not allow yourself to remain there. While you may find it comforting to be in the security of home, you must also learn to forge your own path. The past should be used as a guide for the future. Learn to focus on the present, and truly be aware. 

Another reading of the Six of Cups reversed is that you may feel as though you are disconnected from your childhood self, and that child's dreams, which may sometimes be unrealistic. Not reaching these goals can be painful, but sometimes reality carves a path for you that you must follow, and you shouldn't blame yourself for your choices. Take the time to think about where you want to be now and how you can reach your goals, instead of just dreaming about them.

SEVEN OF CUPS (Upright)

To draw the Seven of Cups in a reading shows that you need to clearly see the shadows and visions in your imagination, not only in your dreams but also in the real world. You should be careful of wishful thinking and be alert of the choices that you make. In one sense, the Seven of Cups indicates that you are a dreamer who is both excited and afraid of the things that you see in your unconscious. In another, the Seven of Cups is a reminder that although it is good to have dreams and wishes, it is even better to take action attaining those dreams. At one point in life, you will need to stop fantasizing and face the reality of life.

If you are unable to make a decision due to the many options that are available, you should evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each option so as to make the best choice. It is important to exercise caution when you are making your decision, as the card itself seems to show there is not only wonders and treasures that are available to you, but also monsters and shadows.

There are some cases when the Seven of Cups may show that you are living in ways that are not necessarily grounded in real life - that your actions are guided by illusions that you feed yourself. Your ideas may be so up in the clouds, developed only on your imagination. As such, you will need to separate what is real and what is not so that you can make better choices.

The Seven of Cups is also linked with temptation. This applies in the upright meaning and also the Seven of Cups reversal meaning.

Eight of Cups (Upright),"-------------------------------------------------
EIGHT OF CUPS (Upright)

The Eight of Cups signifies time for change or transition, by means of walking away from something. Just like a caterpillar has to die before transforming into a beautiful butterfly, we all need to transform ourselves in our lives from time to time. This is the case especially after being tired of living what was the day to day, and embarking on a journey that will help one have a deeper understanding about life in general.

Getting the upright side of this card shows that you are dissatisfied with your life and need to experience a higher purpose in life. You may have been exploring your options, flitting about from one choice to another, tasting the wine in each cup, as a means to sort out what it is that you really want with your life. You are now experiencing a feeling of exhaustion - and are coming to a realization that you must step away from what is familiar. It is a choice, and a recognition that true happiness will not be found in what you have already created. 

More often than not, getting the Eight of Cups shows that one is tired of the worldly things and is about to embark on a much more spiritual journey. And if that’s the case, then be happy, because change happens when we most need it.

EIGHT OF CUPS (Reversed)

Getting the reversed Eight of Cups can show that one is in a state of confusion about which path they are supposed to take. The confusion usually arises from not knowing what is best for you and in the end, drifting in a sea of uncertainty is going to be the resulting effect. 

One is likely to find themselves being aimless and not having clear cut goals in their lives. And in the end, they almost always end up following wherever the waves of life take them.

On the other hand, you may be aware of what you need to do. There is something that in your life that has for a long time stopped bringing you joy or pleasure, and though your soul's desire is to fly away from it, you find yourself remaining. The thought of leaving the security of what you have built fills you with fear - you are scared of both change and of losing something that has given you great comfort. 

Most people usually find themselves stuck in limbo because they are stuck between two important decisions. For instance, one might want to change and work on themselves for the better, and at the same time, they may not in a position to make the necessary sacrifices that are necessary in order to achieve. We must have courage, to believe that we deserve better, that there are even more joyous things that are awaiting us if we take this journey.
